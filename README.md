## Feedback about the project
  It is a really interesting project, that presented for me the opportunity to practise and refresh my skills in React and also a learning experience as I learned new things about the GitHub API and the different features it presents. Due to time issues I couldn't add any more features, but I'm looking forward to improving the platform.
